## Data Science and Engineering

   I’m a data scientist specializing in experimental design, 
   machine learning, and creating beautiful visualizations. 
   My background in pharmacy helps me understand data’s potential 
   for improving healthcare. And, thanks to my experience in 
   customer service, I’m great at coming up with solutions on the spot.
